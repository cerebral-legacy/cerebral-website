## 4: Render challenge

It's time for your first challenge!

- Add another state to the store called *appTitle*
- Create a heading which displays *appTitle* before the existing HeaderButton-component using a new component and call it *App*
- Make HeaderButton-component a child of *App*-component


Now if you are finished you may compare your solution to the one we will use from now on for the following steps in this tutorial.

Btw. you can find the endresult of every step in a folder inside **./parts/** Just overwrite the current files with those folders content to get there.
