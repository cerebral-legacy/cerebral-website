## Creating actions

Signals in Cerebral execute actions. An actions is just a function that receives a context:

```javascript
function myAction(context) { ... }
```

This context is created by Cerebral using its **context providers**. There are several kinds of context providers and you can also create your own. By default Cerebral will create four properties on this context:

```javascript
function myAction({input, state, output, services}) {

}
```

- **input** represents the initial payload (object) passed into the signal. Any outputs from an action will be merged and passed as input to the next action
- **state** has methods for changing and getting the state of your application
- **output** can pass a payload (object) that will be merged with the current input, allowing the next action(s) to use it. Asynchronous actions require you to call an output to move on to the next action
- **services** allows you to do side effects like HTTP and other things. Use of services is also tracked and presented by the debugger

### Changing state
In the demo application we are using an operator to copy the **title** value from the input into our model:
