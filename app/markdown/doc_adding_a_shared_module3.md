As you can see our service returns a promise where we call an **output.success** function when it is successful and **output.error** if something goes wrong. The action also has two properties added to it. The **async** property tells Cerebral that this action runs asynchronously. The **outputs** property defines what outputs this action should have and also allows Cerebral to statically analyze the execution of the signal chain to verify that it is defined correctly.

#### Best practices
When you depend on some library it is quite common to create a module that exposes services wrapping what you need from that library. By doing that it is also very easy to share that module with other Cerebral developers. Wrapping other libraries with Cerebral is of course not necessary, but it will help with your mental image of changes in your app because the debugger will now know about these services and when they are called.
