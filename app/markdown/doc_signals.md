## Signals

To change the state of your application you have to trigger a signal. A signal controls the execution of actions using chains. That means it is not the signal itself that handles the state changes, it handles the flow of state changes. This is where Cerebral is unique. You might have heard of [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) or [asynquence](https://github.com/getify/asynquence). These are really great tools that also handles flow, but they are not specifically built to handle application state changes and notify a view layer about what state changes has been done. Signals in Cerebral are all about that.

### Defining a signal
Signals are defined using what we call **chains**. A chain is just an array:

*chains/doSomething.js*
```javascript
import actionA from '../actions/actionA'
import actionB from '../actions/actionB'

export default [
  actionA,
  actionB
]
```

*controller.js*
```javascript
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import Model from 'cerebral-model-immutable'
import doSomething from './chains/doSomething'

const controller = Controller(Model({}))

controller.addSignals({
  buttonClicked: doSomething
})
```

When this signal triggers it will first run **actionA** and then run **actionB**. Nothing special about that. But signals has more complex flow control than this. For example if **actionA** is defined as an async action it will wait for it to finish before executing **actionB**:

```javascript
import asyncActionA from '../actions/asyncActionA'
import actionB from '../actions/actionB'

export default [
  asyncActionA,
  actionB // Runs when A is done
]
```

#### Parallel execution
Sometimes you want two, or more, asynchronous actions to run in parallel. You achieve that by putting the actions inside another array:

```javascript
import asyncActionA from '../actions/asyncActionA'
import asyncActionB from '../actions/asyncActionB'
import actionC from '../actions/actionC'

export default [
  [
    asyncActionA,
    asyncActionB
  ],
  actionC // Runs when both A and B is done
]
```

### Paths
When handling application state changes it is very typical that things happen conditionally. A server response is not always a success, users might have different roles and maybe you only want to run certain flows when the user is authenticated. Normally we use IF statements to handle this in our code, but Cerebral signals identifies objects as conditional paths:

```javascript
import getItems from '../actions/getItems'
import setItems from '../actions/setItems'
import setItemsError from '../actions/setItemsError'

export default [
  getItems, {
    success: [
      setItems
    ],
    error: [
      setItemsError
    ]
  }
]
```

The action **getItems** will at some point output either a *success* or an *error*. The signal maps this output to the corresponding path and executes it. Here is an other example:

```javascript
import isLoggedIn from '../actions/isLoggedIn'
import showHiddenThing from '../actions/showHiddenThing'

export default [
  isLoggedIn, {
    true: [
      showHiddenThing
    ],
    false: []
  }
]
```
Even though nothing happens when the user is not logged in we explicitly say that nothing does happen using an empty array. This reads better because it tells "the next developer" that the user might not be logged in. It also makes it very easy to later extend this chain as all possible scenarios are defined.

### Composing chains
With the spread operator we can compose these chains (arrays) together. As an example we want to fetch items when the application loads, but also have a button click that does the same thing. We first define a chain:

*chains/updateItems.js*
```javascript
import getItems from '../actions/getItems'
import setItems from '../actions/setItems'
import setItemsError from '../actions/setItemsError'

export default [
  getItems, {
    success: [
      setItems
    ],
    error: [
      setItemsError
    ]
  }
]
```

And now we can define our two signals **appMounted** and **refreshClicked**. When the app mounts we want to fetch both the items and the notifications, but on the button click we only want to fetch the items.

*chains/loadInitialData.js*
```js
import updateItems from '../chains/updateItems'
import updateNotifications from '../chains/updateNotifications'

export default [
  ...updateItems,
  ...updateNotifications
]
```
Note the [Spread...](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) - Operator here from ES6.
If we don't use or forget to use the ... - Operator the array gets added into this chain and therefore is treated as an async branch (as discussed in [Parallel execution][] in this Chapter).
*controller.js*
```js
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import Model from 'cerebral/models/immutable'
import loadInitialData from './chains/loadInitialData'
import updateItems from './chains/updateItems'

const controller = Controller(Model({}))

controller.addSignals({
  appMounted: loadInitialData,
  refreshClicked: updateItems
})
```

The debugger is not affected by this composition, it will think of it as if the two chains were defined inline.
