Adding an item to our list and saving it to the server might seem like a simple thing to do, but as you can see, there is quite a lot happening. And this is not Cerebral complexity, this is application complexity. What we want is:

1. Optimistically add our item to the list
2. Reset the title in our new item input
3. Disable the input by setting our application in a saving state
4. Post item to the server
5. If the server returns success we want to merge an ID into our optimistically added item
6. If the server returns an error we want to remove our optimistically added item
7. No matter what the server returns, we want to put our application back from saving state, which enables the input again

As you can see this process is well reflected in the chain above. That is why we often say that signals executes a decision tree, or a behaviour tree. It works very much like we think. This helps create a mental image of how such complex flows run.

#### Best practices
You have now gotten insight into how you can define your actions from scratch. When developing applications you will depend heavily on the **operators** to avoid creating new actions for every little state change. You will also start to create your own action factories and even chain factories to be reused in different signals. You will be surprised how quickly Cerebral becomes more like describing behaviour with legoblocks, rather than implementing logic.

Since chains are declarative, meaning that they do not have implementation logic, it is possible to describe them without thinking implementation. With your team or colleagues you can talk about what should happen in your application when a signal triggers. Sometimes you can use **operators** to describe it, other times you just name an action that you will implement later. But most importantly a chain description will make it very easy for "the next developer", that also being you, to build a mental image of what is going on.

#### Challenge
Give new items an **$isNew** property which defaults to a true value. Use the operator **delay** in the **success** path and change the **$isNew** property of the first item in the list to *false* after 10 seconds. Then use this property in the UI to indicate when the item is new. Note that **delay** means that the signal will hold, so you will probably need to figure out where the *isSaving* should run.
